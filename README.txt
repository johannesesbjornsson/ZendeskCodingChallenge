Hello!
Code is written in python 3.6.5 and bash 3.2.57
Might need to change top line of ALL python scripts as python path is "#!/usr/local/bin/python3" and "#!/bin/bash" in script accessAPIs.sh
To run ticket viewer app you write ./main.py in the terminal and press enter (didn't include a man page for the script because it takes no input)
The test_cli.py you need to change the variable "python" in the top of the main funcntion as well as provide the full file name of your python3
Enjoy
